# Preparations for Social Distancing / Isolation.

Preparation recommendations for [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) / isolation in preparation for CoViD19 Pandemic

The following are notes composed quickly to provide a recommendation to some friends and family.  Thought it might be useful to share.

Social distancing will [help to protect the community from the spread of SARS-COV-2 (virus)](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/php/185/185_factsheet_social_distancing.pdf) and from getting COVID-19 (disease).  Isolating yourself at home (retreating to safety, like a turtle in its shell) may be easier said than done, but preparing well will lessen the risk of exposure (or amount of exposure) from having to leave your home to get supplies or for whater reason.

**Masks, Goggles and Gloves**
These are out of stock nearly everywhere, globally, since late January. But it is possible your nearest [Walmart](https://twitter.com/tonycecala/status/1232061277494747137) or Home Depot, or local hardware store even, could still have some. But if the [lines are long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7-KN-52GxU) you may be putting yourself in harm's way due to exposure to others in line who may infected and shedding the virus.

While the CDC does not yet recommend the general public have [personal protective equipment](https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faqs/personal-protective-equipment.html) (PPE), it's up to you. Do note this [warning from the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/masks-and-n95-respirators#s4):

*People with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or other medical conditions that make breathing difficult should check with their healthcare provider before using an N95 respirator because the N95 respirator can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe.*

There are numerous brands and models of [Filtering Facepiece Respirators](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html) (FFRs).  The FFR specifications will vary based on the performance characteristics for the [country's rating method](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf).  U.S., and European rating levels include:

- P2 FFR protection: U.S.: NIOSH [N95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html) / [R95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/r95list1.html) / [P95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/p95list1.html) and [Surgical N95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource3surgicaln95.html), or European: FFP2 (which is slightly less protection than N95)
- P3 FFR protection: U.S.: NIOSH [N99](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n99list1.html) / [P99](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/p99list1.html), or [N100](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n100list1.html) / [P100](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/p100list1.html), or European: FFP3 (which is slightly less protection than N100)
- Surgical mask: [Different from FFR](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandingDifference3-508.pdf), a surgical mask does NOT provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles and is not considered respiratory protection. A surgical mask will lessen the risk of you spreading the virus to others, if you are infected.

An exhalation valve will let you breathe easier and keep your mask from getting wet sooner.  A person who is sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should use a surgical mask to lessen the spread of the virus to others.  A FFR makes breathing harder, and if the FFR has an exhalation valve, that gives no protection against an infected person from spreading the virus as droplets will exit the facepiece when talking, coughing, or even just when breathing.

There is quite a [variety of PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/RespiratorInfographics.html) (personal protective equipment), mostly used by medical workers.

Eye protection: Since the virus can, allegedly, enter through mucus tissue), Fluid Barrier Goggles (also known as Chemical Splash Safety Goggles) might be important as well.

Plastic gloves: Yes.  [TODO: Add example, ... disposable, latex-free, protective gloves.  Also referred to as nitrile exam gloves.]

Disposable masks are not meant to be re-used. There aren't enough masks (yet) for there to be enough for everyone to use nonetheless enough for each person using one to dispose of afterward.  And chemically sanitizing the resporator masks [could lessen significantly their effectiveness](https://twitter.com/chrismartenson/status/1233402248052510720).  A method to cope, by those in the affected areas, has been to heat the mask to 150 degrees farhenheit (or 66 degrees celcius), which will likely kill the virus.  Nine or so days might be enough time to leave a mask sit, before wearing again as any virus on the mask (and most bacteria) would likely have died by then.  [TODO: The masks with a plastic exhilation valve will melt or otherwise will render the mask ineffective, at some temperature. Not sure if they can be disinfected with heat and yet remain usable.]

**Supplies**

Plan for having enough for what, ... maybe six weeks, or three months even?  Not a bit of this isn't something you can use later if this ends up being a nothingburger.

- Hand Sanitizer (70% Alcohol).  Do not share your bottle, each person should have their own. A large refill can be used to re-fill the travel-sized bottles. These all will be hard to find at stores at some point.
- Hand soap and body wash
- Hand towels (again, do not share. each person should have their own, plus spares while others being laundered.)
- Kleenex/tissues, including travel sized packets to have tissue for things like [touching door handles or elevator buttons](https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpXoY_1EG8Y&t=53)
- Paper towels (as there will be lots of surfaces needing wiping)
- Disinfecting wipes (you might find these very useful)
- Toilet tissue (In parts of Asia, this was a desparately needed commodity that the markets ran out of first)
- Garbage bags
- Surface disinfectants: Certain [chemical concoctions](https://infectioncontrol.tips/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019nCoV-Surface-Disinfection-Methods.pdf) such as hydrogen peroxide at the proper dilution are [effective at quickly killing the virus on surfaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088920300081).  Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) at the proper dilution can work as well.  Lysol spray too.
- Laundry detergent: You'll be doing laundry frequently. Everything worn gets washed. Get some laundry detergent pods too, even if you don't normally use those.
- Bottled water (your discretion).  Maybe some 5 gallon jugs as well, though individual sized bottle watter lessens contamination from multiple openings / closings of caps.
- Canned and frozen food, including possibly the box milk that doesn't need refrigeration before opening.  Also dried fruits and nuts. [Recommendations for those with young kids](https://twitter.com/papers_pleas/status/1231976104480649217).  Perhaps plan for several weeks before your next visit to the market, which may or may not have supplies.

**Medical**

- Oximeter (fingertip pulse oximeter, blood oxygen saturation monitor). You might want this to monitor your "5th vital sign" and [here's how and why](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YyMiSUfZtyU).
- Thermometer (oral). One per person, don't share.
- Prescriptions for the next couple months.  If you get those now, you might save a trip to the doctor or pharmacist (which is where many infected people will be).
- Vitamin tables (especially Vitamin D if not going outside)
n OTC medicines (e.g., pain releivers, cough suppressant/couph drops). There may be [negative effects though from taking medication that reduces a fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBHyBrbU6EI) when your body is trying to fight an infection.  Same with cough drops ... they are not for suppressing symptoms that need medical attention.

**Household and Other**

- Solar charger for electronics (USB charger, for mobile phone, tablet).  Other chargers suitable for laptop even.  You never know what's coming.
- Propane tanks (keep your full or get a spare).  This was suggested as being helpful in areas where there was a shortage of masks, and sanitizing of a used mask (not recommended by the medical community, but people do it) was done using the outside BBQ grill.
- Fill your gas tank in (all) your vehicle(s).  If you drive soemtimes, or need to go somewhere distant, you don't want to be worrying about finding a gas station that is still open.
- Space heater.  If there is aeresol transmission of the virus (which it increasingly looks like what is happening), it could spread through central air or cooling.   Having a room space heater might be a better alternative.
- Books / games / etc.  If you are cooped up at home for weeks, you mgiht go nuts relying on Netflix and Facebook to pass the time.
- Whisle / bell / noisemaker.  If someone is ill in your home and isolated to a room (e.g., sent home from hospital because there's no more room), that person may benefit from having a bell, whisle or other noisemaker to signal the need for assistance.
- HEPA filter, Humidifier: HEPA filters can help to "clean" the air in a room.  Humidifiers may help lessen the duration that a [virus will last on a surface and infect others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite).
- Rack for deliveries: You may receive things you need via delivery. Have a plan so that you do not need to open the door to receive the item.  This may include a doorbell camera/speaker (e.g., Ring) as well, for instance.  [TODO: Items brought in from the outside present a higher risk of exposure.]
- Go bag: You may head to the hospital and end up in quarantine for weeks.  Have a bag with clothes, toiletries, other items ready to go with you.
- ID renewal: If your ID, subscriptions, etc. expire in the next months, might as well get that renewed early.

**Tips**

- [Wash your hands](https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1232534561650855936) often.  Using hand sanitizer even after washing might help.
- If you can find the travel-size Lysol spray, that might be useful if you are out (e.g., to spray on shopping cart handles).
- [Disinfect your mobile phone](https://www.mdedge.com/infectiousdisease/article/111734/healthcare-acquired-infections/viruses-mobile-phones), perhaps as frequently as washing your hands. ([paywall free](https://outline.com/fhnUUJ))
- Learn the "Ebola handshake" (which is an elbow bump, instead of shaking hands).  Or just greet verbally and a nod / bow / whatever lessens physical contact.
- Avoid even getting near [public bathrooms](https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpXoY_1EG8Y&t=117). SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is found in feces of an infected person, as well as in urine. Every flush by anyone infected creates a risk of contamination to you.  And even if you wash your hands then close the faucet, you likely just contaminated your fingers again. Understand the [fecal-oral route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal%E2%80%93oral_route)s of transmission.
- Drinking alcohol can weaken your body's immune system.
- Raise the temperature in your home and increase the humidity -- both of which [may shorten the longevity of the virus](https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1233807389062725633).
- Get to know your neighbors, if you don't already.   Be proactive with elderly family, friends and neighbors, those with various challenges, and those who might otherwise might end up in a bad spot without help from others.
- Stay informed!: [TODO: Enter links here for CDC, CIDRAP, and a handful of other sites]. Some online media is hidden behind a paywall. Pasting the URL into [Outline.com](https://Outline.com) is one fo the many [ways to bypass paywalls](https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/12-ways-to-get-past-a-paywall).
