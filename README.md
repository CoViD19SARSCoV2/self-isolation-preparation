# Preparations for Social Distancing / Isolation.

Preparation recommendations for [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) / isolation in preparation for CoViD19 Pandemic

The following are notes composed quickly to suggest to some friends and family.  Thought it might be useful to share.

Social distancing will help to protect yourself from the spread of the SARS-COV-2 (virus) and from getting COVID-19 (disease).  This may be easier said than done, but preparing well will lessen the exposure by having to leave your home to get supplies or for whater reason.

**Masks, Goggles and Gloves**
These are out of stock nearly everywhere, globally, since late January. 

While the CDC does not yet recommend the general public have [personal protective equipment](https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faqs/personal-protective-equipment.html) (PPE), it's up to you. Do note this [warning from the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/masks-and-n95-respirators#s4):

*People with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or other medical conditions that make breathing difficult should check with their healthcare provider before using an N95 respirator because the N95 respirator can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe.*

There are numerous brands and models of [Filtering Facepiece Respirators](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html) (FFRs).  For reference: 

- P2 FFP protection: U.S.: NIOSH N95 / R95 / P95, or European: FFP2 (which is slightly less protection than N95)  
- P3 FFP protection: U.S.: NIOSH N99, or N100, or European: FFP3 (which is slightly less protection than N100) 
- Surgical mask: [Different from FFP](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandDifferenceInfographic-508.pdf), a surgical mask does NOT provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles and is not considered respiratory protection. A surgical mask will lessen the risk of you spreading the virus to others, if you are infected.

An exhalation valve will let you breathe easier and keep your mask from getting wet sooner.

There is quite a [variety of PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/RespiratorInfographics.html) (personal protective equipment), mostly used by medical workers.

Eye protection: Since the virus can, allegedly, enter through mucus tissue), Fluid Barrier Goggles (also known as Chemical Splash Safety Goggles) might be important as well.

Plastic gloves: Yes.  [TODO: Add example, ... disposable, latex-free, protective gloves.]

Disposable masks are not meant to be re-used.

**Supplies**

Plan for having enough for what, ... maybe six weeks, or three months even?  Not a bit of this isn't something you can use later if this ends up being a nothingburger.

- Hand Sanitizer (70% Alcohol).  Do not share bottle, each person should have their own.  This will be hard to find at stores at some point.
- Hand soap.
- Hand towels (again, do not share. each person should have their own, plus spares while others being laundered.)
- Garbage bags
- Paper towels
- Disinfecting wipes (you might find these very useful)
- Bleach (chlorine, properly diluted, is a good disinfectant)
- Toilet tissue (In parts of Asia, this was a desparately needed commodity that the markets ran out of first)
- Bottled water (your discretion).  Maybe some 5 gallon jugs as well.
- Canned and frozen food.  Perhaps plan for 10 weeks before your next visit to the market, which may or may not have supplies.

**Medical**

- Oximeter (fingertip pulse oximeter, blood oxygen saturation monitor). You might want this to monitor your "5th vital sign" and [here's how and why](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YyMiSUfZtyU).
- Thermometer (oral). One per person, don't share.
- Prescriptions for the next couple months.  If you get those now, you might save a trip to the doctor or pharmacist (which is where many infected people will be). 
- Vitamin tables (especially Vitamin D if not going outside)

**Household and Other**

- Solar charger for electronics (USB charger, for mobile phone, tablet).  Other chargers suitable for laptop even.  You never know what's coming.
- Propane tanks (keep your full or get a spare).  This was suggested as being helpful in areas where there was a shortage of masks, and sanitizing of a used mask (not recommended by the medical community, but people do it) was done using the outside BBQ grill.
- Fill your gas tank in (all) your vehicle(s).  If you drive soemtimes, or need to go somewhere distant, you don't want to be worrying about finding a gas station that is still open.
- Space heater.  If there is aeresol transmission of the virus (which it increasingly looks like what is happening), it could spread through central air or cooling.   Having a room space heater might be a better alternative.
- Books / games / etc.  If you are cooped up at home for weeks, you mgiht go nuts relying on Netflix and Facebook to pass the time.
- Whisle / bell / noisemaker.  If someone is ill in your home and isolated to a room (e.g., sent home from hospital because there's no more room), that person may benefit from having a bell, whisle or other noisemaker to signal the need for assistance.
- HEPA filter, Humidifier: HEPA filters can help to "clean" the air in a room.  Humidifiers may help lessen the duration that a [virus will last on a surface and infect others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite).
- Rack for deliveries: You may receive things you need via delivery. Have a plan so that you do not need to open the door to receive the item.  This may include a doorbell camera/speaker (e.g., Ring) as well, for instance.  [TODO: Items brought in from the outside present a higher risk of exposure.]
- Go bag: You may head to the hospital and end up in quarantine for weeks.  Have a bag with clothes, toiletries, other items ready to go with you.
- ID renewal: If your ID, subscriptions, etc. expire in the next months, might as well get that renewed early.

**Tips**

- [Disinfect your mobile phone](https://www.mdedge.com/infectiousdisease/article/111734/healthcare-acquired-infections/viruses-mobile-phones), perhaps as frequently as washing your hands. ([paywall free](https://outline.com/fhnUUJ))
