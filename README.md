# Preparations for Social Distancing / Isolation.

Preparation recommendations for [social distancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing) / home isolation in preparation for [CoViD19 Pandemic](https://www.abundance.org/coronavirus-faqs-by-dr-megan-murray-harvard-infectious-disease-specialist)

Social distancing will [help to protect the community from the spread of SARS-COV-2 (virus)](http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/sites/default/files/public/php/185/185_factsheet_social_distancing.pdf) and from getting COVID-19 (disease).  Isolating yourself at home (retreating to safety, like a turtle in its shell) may be easier said than done, but preparing well will lessen your risk of exposure (or amount of exposure) from having to leave your home to get supplies or for whater reason.

**Masks, Goggles and Gloves**
These are out of stock nearly everywhere, globally, since late January. But it is possible your nearest [Walmart](https://twitter.com/tonycecala/status/1232061277494747137) or Home Depot, or local hardware store even, could still have some. But if the [lines are long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7-KN-52GxU) you may be putting yourself in harm's way due to exposure to others in line who may be infected and shedding the virus.

While the CDC does not yet recommend the general public have [personal protective equipment](https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faqs/personal-protective-equipment.html) (PPE), it's up to you. Do note this [warning from the FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-infection-control/masks-and-n95-respirators#s4):

*People with chronic respiratory, cardiac, or other medical conditions that make breathing difficult should check with their healthcare provider before using an N95 respirator because the N95 respirator can make it more difficult for the wearer to breathe.*

There are numerous brands and models of [Filtering Facepiece Respirators](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html) (FFRs).  The FFR specifications will vary based on the performance characteristics for the [country's rating method](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1791500O/comparison-ffp2-kn95-n95-filtering-facepiece-respirator-classes-tb.pdf).  U.S., and European rating levels include:

- P2 FFR protection: U.S.: NIOSH [N95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n95list1.html) / [R95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/r95list1.html) / [P95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/p95list1.html) and [Surgical N95](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/respsource3surgicaln95.html), or European: FFP2 (which is slightly less protection than N95)
- P3 FFR protection: U.S.: NIOSH [N99](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n99list1.html) / [P99](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/p99list1.html), or [N100](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/n100list1.html) / [P100](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/topics/respirators/disp_part/p100list1.html), or European: FFP3 (which is slightly less protection than N100)
- Surgical mask: [Different from FFR](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/pdfs/UnderstandingDifference3-508.pdf), a surgical mask does NOT provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection from inhaling smaller airborne particles and is not considered [respiratory protection](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/n95-mask-surgical-prevent-transmission-coronavirus). A surgical mask will, however, lessen the risk of you spreading the virus to others, if you are infected.

An exhalation valve will let you breathe easier and keep your mask from getting wet sooner.  A person who is sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 should use a surgical mask to lessen the spread of the virus to others.  A FFR makes breathing harder, and if the FFR has an exhalation valve, that gives no protection against an infected person from spreading the virus as droplets will exit the facepiece when talking, coughing, or even just when breathing.

There is quite a [variety of PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/RespiratorInfographics.html) (personal protective equipment), mostly used by medical workers.  With an inferior solution being favorable over no solution, there is evidence that a do-it-yourself (DIY) homemade [mask made from a cotton T-shirt or tea cloth is more effective than having no mask](https://smartairfilters.com/en/blog/diy-homemade-mask-protect-virus-coronavirus).

Eye protection: Since the virus can, allegedly, enter through mucus tissue), Fluid Barrier Goggles (also known as Chemical Splash Safety Goggles) might be important as well.

Plastic gloves: Yes.  [TODO: Add example, ... disposable, latex-free, protective gloves.  Also referred to as nitrile exam gloves.]

Disposable masks are not meant to be [re-used](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hcwcontrols/recommendedguidanceextuse.html). There aren't enough masks (yet) for there to be enough for everyone to use nonetheless enough for each person using one to dispose of afterward.  And chemically sanitizing the resporator masks could lessen significantly their effectiveness, as described in this [commentary from Stanford](https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3A%2F%2Fstanfordmedicine.app.box.com%2Fv%2Fcovid19-PPE-1-1). A method to cope, by those in the affected areas, has been to heat the mask to 158 degrees farhenheit (or 70 degrees celcius), for 30 minutes or more, which will likely kill this virus, presuming it [behaves the same as another coronavirus](https://europepmc.org/article/med/14631830).  Alternatively, nine or so days might be enough [time to leave a mask sit, before wearing it again](https://twitter.com/chrismartenson/status/1233402248052510720) -- as any virus on the mask (and most bacteria) would likely have died by then.  [TODO: The masks with a plastic exhilation valve will melt or otherwise will render the mask ineffective, at some temperature. Not sure if they can be disinfected with heat and yet remain usable.]  Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation [(UVGI) can be effective](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4699414). Also, see the [bulletin from 3M](https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1816576O/disinfection-of-disposable-respirators-technical-bulletin.pdf).

**Supplies**

Plan for having enough for what, ... maybe three weeks, or two months even?  All of these supply recommendations can be used at a later time, so even if they are not needed for this specific event, the money won't have been wasted.

- Hand Sanitizer (70% Alcohol).  Do not share your bottle, each person should have their own. A large refill can be used to re-fill the travel-sized bottles. These all will be hard to find at stores at some point.
- Hand soap and body wash.  Hand soap helps because when you [wash your hands properly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGW3bbcb3Y), the virus gets rinsed away. An antimicrobial hand soap, such as Hibiclens antimicrobial skin liquid soap, may work to kill the virus as well.
- Hand towels (again, do not share. each person should have their own, plus spares while others being laundered.)
- Kleenex/tissues, including travel sized packets to have tissue for things like [touching door handles or elevator buttons](https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpXoY_1EG8Y&t=53)
- Paper towels (as there will be lots of surfaces needing wiping)
- Disinfecting wipes (you might find these very useful). Caution: Do not flush disinfecting wipes down the toilet, that could really make the situation for home isolation become much worse doing that.
- Toilet tissue (In much of the world, this is a desparately needed commodity that the markets run out of first)
- Garbage bags
- Surface disinfectants: Certain [chemical concoctions](https://infectioncontrol.tips/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2019nCoV-Surface-Disinfection-Methods.pdf) such as hydrogen peroxide at the proper dilution are [effective at quickly killing the virus on surfaces](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088920300081).  Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) at the proper dilution can work as well.  Lysol spray too.  Check out this list of [EPA approved biocidal products](https://www.americanchemistry.com/Novel-Coronavirus-Fighting-Products-List.pdf).
- Laundry detergent: You'll be doing laundry frequently. Everything worn gets washed. Get some laundry detergent pods too, even if you don't normally use those.
- Bottled water, [for various reasons](https://twitter.com/aetiology/status/1233427492742012928).  Maybe some 5 gallon jugs as well, though individual sized bottled water lessens contamination from multiple openings / closings of caps.  Individual bottles are especially useful should a member of the home fall ill, as the possibly contaminated empty bottle can then be discarded.
- Canned and frozen food, including possibly the box milk that doesn't need refrigeration before opening.  Also dried fruits and nuts. [Recommendations for those with young kids](https://twitter.com/papers_pleas/status/1231976104480649217).  Perhaps plan for several weeks before your next visit to the market, which may or may not have supplies once you eventually can make that trip.
- Batteries: You might be using your TV remote, computer mouse, and other battery-powered electronics more than normal, and you don't want to go out (or send out for delivery) just for batteries.

**Medical**

- Oximeter (fingertip pulse oximeter, blood oxygen saturation monitor). You might want this to monitor your "5th vital sign" and [here's how and why](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YyMiSUfZtyU).
- Thermometer (oral). One per person, don't share.
- Prescriptions for the next couple months.  If you get those now, you might save a trip to the doctor or pharmacist (which is where many infected people will be).
- Vitamin tablets (especially Vitamin D if not going outside, and Vitamin C if you are not eating fruits, and Zinc). Here's a [prep list showing a supplements section](https://twitter.com/Barton_options/status/1233980185348911104).
- OTC medicines (e.g., cough suppressant/couph drops). [Ibuprofin (e.g., Advil, Motrin), naproxen (e.g., Aleve), aspirin or cortisone SHOULD NOT be taken](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/anti-inflammatory-drugs-may-aggravate-coronavirus-infection) if you are ill, as both are harmful if you also are infected. There may be [negative effects though from taking medication that reduces a fever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBHyBrbU6EI) when your body is trying to fight an infection.  Same with cough drops ... they are not for suppressing symptoms that need medical attention.

**Household and Other**

- Solar charger for electronics (USB charger, for mobile phone, tablet).  Other chargers suitable for laptop even.  You never know what's coming.
- Propane tanks (keep yours full or get a spare).  This was suggested as being helpful in areas where there was a shortage of masks, and sanitizing of a used mask (not recommended by the medical community, but people do it) was done using the outside BBQ grill.
- Fill your gas tank in (all) your vehicle(s).  If you drive sometimes, or need to go somewhere distant, you don't want to be worrying about finding a gas station that is still open.
- Space heater.  If there is aeresol transmission of the virus (which it increasingly looks like what is happening), it could spread through central air or cooling.   Having a room space heater might be a better alternative.
- Books / games / etc.  If you are cooped up at home for weeks, you might go nuts relying on Netflix and Facebook to pass the time.
- Whistle / bell / noisemaker.  If someone is ill in your home and isolated to a room (e.g., sent home from hospital because there's no more beds available), that person may benefit from having a bell, whisle or other noisemaker to signal the need for assistance.
- HEPA filter, Humidifier: HEPA filters can help to "clean" the air in a room.  Humidifiers may help lessen the duration that a [virus will last on a surface and infect others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite).  Humidity levels from 40% to 60% are [recommended](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3551767).
- Rack for deliveries: You may receive things you need via delivery. Have a plan so that you do not need to open the door to receive the item.  This may include a doorbell camera/speaker (e.g., Ring) as well, for instance.  [TODO: Items brought in from the outside present a higher risk of exposure.]
- Go bag: You may suddenly need to head to the hospital and then end up being either admitted, or stuck in quarantine for weeks.  Have a bag with clothes, toiletries, other items ready to go with you.  There is also a go-bag for survival purposes (e.g., to survive short-term, such as 72 hours, without shelter), that may instead be referred to as a [bug-out bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug-out_bag).
- ID renewal: If your ID, subscriptions, etc. expire in the next months, might as well get that renewed early.
- Cash/Financial: You will likely want to (or need to) order online for additional supplies. Try to ensure sufficient funds are available in your bank account or whatever method you use to pay online (e.g., PayPal, etc.)  Additionally, having a higher than normal stash of cash at home may become useful -- especially to pay a deliver driver or neighbor.

**Tips**

- [Wash your hands](https://twitter.com/UNICEF/status/1232534561650855936) often.  Using hand sanitizer even after washing might help.
- If you can find the travel-size Lysol spray, that might be useful if you are out (e.g., to spray on shopping cart handles, then wipe with a napkin or paper towel that you then discard).
- [Disinfect your mobile phone](https://www.prevention.com/health/a31248367/how-to-clean-cell-phone), perhaps as frequently as washing your hands. The [virus can survive 96 hours](https://qz.com/1810508/covid-19-can-likely-live-up-to-96-hours-on-your-phone) (or longer) on many surfaces.
- Learn the "Ebola handshake" (which is an elbow bump, instead of shaking hands).  Or just greet verbally and a nod / bow / whatever lessens physical contact.
- Avoid even getting near [public bathrooms](https://youtube.com/watch?v=TpXoY_1EG8Y&t=117). SARS-COV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is found in feces of an infected person, as well as in urine. Every flush by anyone infected creates a risk of contamination to you.  And even if you wash your hands and then press the lever or turn the knob to shut off the faucet, you likely just contaminated your fingers again. Understand the [fecal-oral route](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal%E2%80%93oral_route)s of transmission.
- Hygiene: Watches, rings, and nail coverings (fake nails) make hand washing much less effective as the virus could get trapped underneath.
- Drinking alcohol can weaken your body's immune system.
- Cash can carry the virus. If you are paying cash and getting change, carry a sandwich size ziploc bag and have the cashier put the cash and change in that bag -- which will let you carry it home safely where you can then disinfect it (using heat and time, or whatever method is deemed sufficient).
- Raise the temperature in your home and increase the humidity -- both of which [may shorten the longevity of the virus](https://twitter.com/angie_rasmussen/status/1233807389062725633) in air or on surfaces.
- Open your windows (if outdoor air temperature is high enough), and [avoid stuffy rooms where there are other people](https://twitter.com/Don_Milton/status/1233946561744429056).  If driving, [don't use the setting for recirculated air](https://twitter.com/Don_Milton/status/1233611245753901056).
- Get to know your neighbors, or touch base if you already know them. Be proactive with elderly family, friends and neighbors, those with various challenges, and those who might otherwise might end up in a bad spot without help from others.
- Don't remain idle. Nearly everybody in the entire world will be negatively impacted by this. Perhaps something you do during this period will improve your situation after it passes, or could help the numerous others who will be in need.
- Stay informed!: [TODO: Enter links here for CDC, CIDRAP, and a handful of other sites]. Some online media is hidden behind a paywall. Pasting the URL into [Outline.com](https://Outline.com) is one fo the many [ways to bypass paywalls](https://www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/12-ways-to-get-past-a-paywall).
